# languages
This repository houses files pertinent to my personal language learning application. The application's purpose is two-fold:

1) To use my personal base of experience in several languages as a fulcrum from which to develop an extensible application which can provide some novel use for a underserved use case in the language learning community. 

2) Perform a feasibility study on the medium of a MEAN stack for this application, specifically as opposed to a mobile environment for the use case which I eventually decide to serve.

At the current point and time, though this web application is only in the very nascent development stages, you may use it/modify it as you wish. 

The working application can be found at:
