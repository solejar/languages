  "description": "This is a general package that contains a web application for my internal language learning purposes. The ultimate goal is two-fold. 1) to use my personal base of experience in several languages as a fulcrum from which to develop an extensible application which can provide some novel use for a underserved use case in the language learning community. 2) Perform a feasibility study on the medium of a MEAN stackfor this application, specifically as opposed to a mobile environment for the use case which I eventually decide to serve.",
