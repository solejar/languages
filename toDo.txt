Decliner:
    Backlog in order:

    Add noun exception gender for expected gender

    
    Add fleeting vowel exceptions

    Add family nouns

    Add foreign words

    Add post request for noted inaccuracies


    Functional: Needed for the app to work correctly
        remaining exceptions : PL: 2 not high priority but should be done eventually,   maybe one day if you're bored out of your mind
        add family nouns (eventually, idgaf tbh)
            ребёнок
            брать
            сестра
            etc
        add fleeting vowel nouns 
            девушка maybe these are programmatic?
            звонок
            etc.
        weird exceptions
            год
            день
            весь
        foreign words which don't get declined
            такси
            кофе
        neuter nouns
            существительное?
            прилагательное
        Add noun gender as tool for expected gender!

        submit button
            This is a little sketchy idk how this is gonna look

    Non-Functional:
    
        Styling
            Mobile vs web sizing
            Add some fun colors
            Maybe box things off?

        error detection: Priority Level: 3
            what to do with garbage inputs?
            I'm thinking about adding an 'else' rule to whatever endings don't have them
            this way, even if garbage inputs, the app won't break or throw needless errors, perhaps alert user to potential wrongdoing? -> only if we go sync route
            should i make this synchronous behind a button? Or live update?

        Maybe look at schema validation
    
    Pre-release, once code base has solidified to v1.0.0:

        Buy a domain, some online mongo allocation as well

        clean up code:
            Make sure there isn't any glaringly bad practice in there

        figure out some methodical way to do unit testing: 3
            run through all options with assertions?
            karma + jasmine?
            don't need to have them all done, but at least get started with it
            so you know how to work on this moving forward

        Design Docs/How-to:
            Hmm this should come before release I suppose?

        //this is also worthwhile to do
        set up post request with noted inaccuracies : 2
            useful to both get input from people, and to have framework for post requests
            maybe even some e-mail integration so I can get e-mailed when something gets submitted (this is maybe not necessary)

    Design decisions:
        Should clear get rid of everything or just the phrase? For now let's do everything

        Button to submit?

        Show users if they potentially submitted not a real word?

    My new idea might require a little more complicated schema...will need to reevaluate this and improve my code base

Text Learner:
    Authentication:
        Need to attach everything to a user account
    Copy and paste text
        Hit button, will tokenize
        and display in paged format
    Data-schema:
        Word:   {
            'name': Str,
            'englishMeaning': Str (is this worth storing? or just come up asynchronously?),
            'howWellKnown': Int (starts from 1-5),
            'partOfSpeech': Str
        }
