Decliner:
    Functional: Needed for the app to work correctly
        remaining exceptions : PL: 2 not high priority but should be done eventually,   maybe one day if you're bored out of your mind
        add family nouns (eventually, idgaf tbh)
            ребёнок
            брать
            сестра
            etc
        add fleeting vowel nouns 
            девушка
            звонок
            etc.
        weird exceptions
            год
        for nouns, if it's only one case taking the error, probably the data model can reflect that, makes life easier

        Clear button
            Options: Do this soon
                To clear out phrase only
                Or to clear out everything
        submit button
            This is a little sketchy idk how this is gonna look

    Non-Functional:
        //do this soonish
        Use ng-hover or something comprobably to alert users to why they can't choose case or gender
    
        Styling
            Mobile vs web sizing
            Add some fun colors
            Maybe box things off?

        error detection: Priority Level: 3
            what to do with garbage inputs?
            I'm thinking about adding an 'else' rule to whatever endings don't have them
            this way, even if garbage inputs, the app won't break or throw needless errors, perhaps alert user to potential wrongdoing? -> only if we go sync route
            should i make this synchronous behind a button? Or live update?
    
    Pre-release, once code base has solidified to v1.0.0:

        Buy a domain, some online mongo allocation as well

        clean up code:
            Make sure there isn't any glaringly bad practice in there

        figure out some methodical way to do unit testing: 3
            run through all options with assertions?
            karma + jasmine?
            don't need to have them all done, but at least get started with it
            so you know how to work on this moving forward

        Design Docs/How-to:
            Hmm this should come before release I suppose?

        //this is also worthwhile to do
        set up post request with noted inaccuracies : 2
            useful to both get input from people, and to have framework for post requests
            maybe even some e-mail integration so I can get e-mailed when something gets submitted (this is maybe not necessary)

Text Learner:
    Authentication:
        Need to attach everything to a user account
    Copy and paste text
        Hit button, will tokenize
        and display in paged format
    Data-schema:
        Word:   {
            'name': Str,
            'englishMeaning': Str (is this worth storing? or just come up asynchronously?),
            'howWellKnown': Int (starts from 1-5),
            'partOfSpeech': Str
        }
