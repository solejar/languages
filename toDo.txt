remaining exceptions : PL: 2 not high priority but should be done eventually,   maybe one day if you're bored out of your mind
    add family nouns (eventually, idgaf tbh)
        ребёнок
        брать
        сестра
        etc
    add fleeting vowel nouns 
        девушка
        звонок
        etc.
    weird exceptions
        год
    for nouns, if it's only one case taking the error, probably the data model can reflect that, makes life easier
gender improvement: 1
    if possible, try to put it only on adj+noun
error detection: Priority Level: 3
    what to do with garbage inputs?
    I'm thinking about adding an 'else' rule to whatever endings don't have them
    this way, even if garbage inputs, the app won't break or throw needless errors, perhaps alert user to potential wrongdoing? -> only if we go sync route
    should i make this synchronous behind a button? Or live update?
move on to document reading : 4 (I think)
figure out some methodical way to do unit testing: 3
    run through all options with assertions?
    karma + jasmine?
    don't need to have them all done, but at least get started with it
    so you know how to work on this moving forward
set up post request with noted inaccuracies : 2
    useful to both get input from people, and to have framework for post requests
put endings, exceptions, and preps in one RU collection
    debatable, this is like a design decision
