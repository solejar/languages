Decliner:
    Backlog in order:
    
    Missing solo exceptions:
        господин
        болгарин
        татарин
        хозяин

    Flesh out what to do if oper indicated is 'else'
        or rather how do I know/indicate that the ruleSet returned is the default?

    Еxpected animateness

    Should I allow user to enter wrong gender mistakenly?
        For example enter male adj and female noun, then just conjugate the male adj into female before starting
        i'm thinking maybe

    Think about not getting all the exceptions at the start, and what that would look like as far the get request is concerned

    Add 'example' field to facilitate easy testing

    Add post request for noted inaccuracies

    What does this app not handle:

        words with multiple forms of plurals
        Non-declinable, non-russian names.

        Currently deciding if I can handle locative case for words like год
    
    Singular personal pronouns? Question pronouns? Determinative?
        work on this after the infrastructure is set up    

    Potential idea:
        word bank!

    Functional: Needed for the app to work correctly
       
        submit button
            Probably only appears if the adj or noun has changed
            we can let people change the case/plurality on the fly (but gender?)

    Non-Functional:
    
        Styling
            Mobile vs web sizing
            Add some fun colors
            Maybe box things off?

        Maybe look at schema validation
    
    Pre-release, once code base has solidified to v1.0.0:

        Buy a domain, some online mongo allocation as well

        clean up code:
            Make sure there isn't any glaringly bad practice in there

        figure out some methodical way to do unit testing: 3
            run through all options with assertions?
            karma + jasmine?
            don't need to have them all done, but at least get started with it
            so you know how to work on this moving forward

        Design Docs/How-to:
            Hmm this should come before release I suppose?
